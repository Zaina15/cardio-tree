# ðŸ«€ CardioTree Classifier

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a Random Forest Classifier trained on the **Indicators of Heart Disease** dataset. This project demonstrates data preprocessing (label encoding and one-hot encoding), model training and evaluation, and visualization of decision trees.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project uses the *Indicators of Heart Disease Dataset* (2020), which contains health-related attributes such as:

- **Demographics:** Age category, sex, race  
- **Lifestyle factors:** Smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity  
- **General health indicators:** BMI, sleep time, physical health, mental health  
- **Target Variable:** HeartDisease (Yes/No)

## ðŸ›  Features

âœ… **Data Preprocessing**
- Label encoding of categorical variables (e.g., HeartDisease, Smoking, Sex)
- One-hot encoding for race categories

âœ… **Model Building**
- Random Forest Classifier with balanced class weights
- Train-test split for model evaluation

âœ… **Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy score on training and test data
- Confusion matrix for performance visualization

âœ… **Decision Tree Visualization**
- Displays how individual decision trees in the random forest make classification decisions

âœ… **Real-world Application Examples**
- Explores potential uses of decision trees in recommendation systems (e.g., book recommendations on Goodreads/Amazon)
